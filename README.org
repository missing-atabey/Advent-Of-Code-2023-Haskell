* Here reside my AOC 2023 solutions in Haskell :)

** Q&A
*** Why would I torture myself like this?

Why not? It's a very different paradigm and it's very very powerful once mastered. I just wanted a way to get good at Haskell fast and this certainly is that.

*** How can I run these?
That's simple! Just clone this repo, edit the main function in the Main.hs file so it uses whatever day's solution u wanna use, run this

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cabal run
#+END_SRC

paste input and press C-d in your terminal to send an EOD signal, and done! Watch as u get the desired solution
