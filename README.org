* Here reside my AOC 2023 solutions in Haskell :)

** Q&A
*** Why would I torture myself like this?

Why not? It's a very different paradigm and it's very very powerful once mastered. I just wanted a way to get good at Haskell fast and this certainly is that.

*** How can I run these?
That's simple! Just clone this repo, CD into the directory, run SRC_<bash>{<cabal run>} and done!
