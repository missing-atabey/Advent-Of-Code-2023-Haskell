* Here reside my AOC 2023 solutions in Haskell :)

** Q&A
*** Why would I torture myself like this?

Why not? It's a very different paradigm and it's very very powerful once mastered. I just wanted a way to get good at Haskell fast and this certainly is that.

*** How can I run these?
That's simple! Just compile the files with ghc :)

Alternatively you could run it on an online compiler [[ https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_haskell_compiler] [like this one :)]]

For either option just make sure to run the corresponding function for whatever part of the challenge u want, and ensure you put the input in stdin
